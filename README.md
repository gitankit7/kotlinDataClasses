AsyncAPI is an open-source specification that allows you to describe and document message-driven APIs.
This document can be updated by non-technical people such as BAs, POs to define the contract, and then we can directly generate code from it using asyncapi/modelina.


Pre-requisites:-
npm install @asyncapi/modelina
